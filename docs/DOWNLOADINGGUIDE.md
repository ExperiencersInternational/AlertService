# Downloading NotificationService

The easiest way to download NotificationService is to let Roblox handle it, you can download it at: (tba).

However, not everyone wants Roblox to manage their updates which is completely understandable. You can instead, download it here from GitHub, but you will be losing out on being able to automatically update NotificationService.

To start downloading, go to the Releases page, and download the source file for the latest version. Once you've downloaded it, copy NotificationService.rbxmx from the ZIP file.

Now, open Roblox Studio, select a template of your choice, and open the plugins tab in the ribbon bar.

Now, press the Plugins Folder button. A Windows/File Explorer or Finder window should open, and you'll want to paste the RBXMX file that you copied earlier.

You've just installed NotificationService, but there's one final step. Due to how Roblox Studio works, you'll need to restart Studio to apply the installation. (this is also recommended if your updating NotificationService)
