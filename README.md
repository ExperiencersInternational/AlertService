# AlertService

As you may know, Roblox Studio doesn't have a notification system for years. Developers are forced to use the output, which not everyone checks. Now, I'm planning to change that, with AlertService. It's a free plugin that I'd suggest you download, it allows players to receive notifications from plugins, and for plugins to send them easily.

If you need help with installing this, or setting AlertService up for your plugin, please check out the docs folder!
