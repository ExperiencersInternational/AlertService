# NotificationService

So, Roblox Studio doesn't really have a proper notification system in place right now, this means that plugins currently have to rely on the output to display important messages. I want to change this with NotificationService, a free plugin that ditches the need to clutter the output, and to instead, make displaying important messages easier. This may be a dependency for some plugins to operate on, if this project turns out well.

Expected release date: Mid April 2022
